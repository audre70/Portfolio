                        During my internship, I partnered with another UX designer in a design sprint that aimed to 
                        improve the Library experience on the iHeart app. I led the cross-functional collaboration 
                        between product management, UX research, engineers, and analytics to deliver a design proposal.

                            improved infrastructure to repair bugs and add new components. The UX team therefore is using

                        <h3>Library gets very little engagement</h3>
                        <p>
                            Few of our unique visitors—only 9.5%—have something saved in Library. Within that group, the vast 
                            majority have very little saved: around <strong>82% have between 1-3 assets</strong>. This indicates 
                            there is something about Library that is <strong>not enticing users to save more</strong>.

                                The Recently Played carousel and Library both serve as areas on Home where users can access content
                                they have previously played or demonstrated interest in that are not associated with content discovery.
                                <br><br>

                                This discrepancy suggests that Library is an <strong>area of potential</strong> where we can

                            The metrics discussed here can be explained by a variety of reasons (e.g. how users save content, feedback when saving content, the Library 
                            entry point, or even a combination of multiple) beyond just the internal organization/design of Library. For this particular initiative, our 
                            scope was the latter. Although this data cannot exactly identify the root cause of the low engagement, it still provides useful directional 
                            insights.

                        Common threads included the <strong>(1) difficulty of getting to saved content</strong> and <strong>(2) how cluttered 
                        Library is</strong>. 
                        Users mentioned the order of displayed content not being relevant to their wants and the excessive
                        number of taps needed to reach assets. We also observed a frequent mismatch in mental models, as even some users 
                        failed to locate certain content (e.g. Artists, Downloads).

                                Sorting is necessary for defining logic in multi-content lists and to empower users to organize their assets according to their preferences.

                                We documented extensive feedback requesting a sorting ability in Library, and there appears to be a user expectation tied to it too. Among 
                                competitors, <strong>6/8 have sorting</strong> and <strong>7/8 surface recent content</strong> in the Library.

                        Given the strengths of a default All view, sorting capabilities, and content-based information architecture, we narrowed down our designs to 
                        <strong>2 top-level navigational structures (filters and tabs)</strong> that could support these criteria.
                        <br><br>
                        This led us to a stage where we had concrete questions that could be answered with testing, so we collaborated with the UX Research Guild to conduct research.

                        We built and launched an <strong>unmoderated study on UserTesting with 15 participants</strong> who were randomly assigned to <strong>one of the two interactive prototypes</strong>
                         and given a series of tasks to complete. We evaluated their behavior to gauge the overall understanding of different parts of our design.

                                    The podcasts tab, downloads tab, episodes card, and show card were all used to reach downloaded podcasts, with 15/15 participants reporting the

                                    Several participants even expressed an expectation for our particular sorting option as the default. One said, “Usually the things that are most recent
                                    are the things you may want to continue with,” validating our hypothesis.

                                    Participants created playlists two ways, 10/15 from the All view and 7/15 from the Playlists view (several demonstrated both), confirming that
                                    the playlist CTA button on the All view has merit.

                                    Many participants found the presence of content discovery/browse features in the floating “New” button unexpected and confusing, so we 
                                    discarded our out-of-the-box idea.

                            Both prototypes universally facilitated successful task completion and clearly communicated Library organization during testing. Participants described both 
                             with words like <strong>easy to use, organized, familiar, and straightforward</strong>.
                            <br><br>
                            Ultimately, both models were relatively compatible with iHeart content offerings and our goals as shown by research.
                            However, it was important to acknowledge that controlled testing environments may not always reveal various advantages or subtleties of 
                            how designs may perform after launch.
                            We thus decided to revisit the two navigation models and conduct an in-depth analysis, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each.

                            We determined the tab-based navigation would be more forgiving in various circumstances for our users. It allows you to quickly
                             switch between viewing content types in <strong>one tap</strong>, rather than two. Moreover, the <strong>visual constant</strong> of the content tabs 
                             serves as <strong>user education</strong> by sectioning off Library assets to their respective sections and rendering visual changes in the content list 
                             less jarring compared to filters.
                            <br><br>
                            From here, we landed on a final recommendation that we were confident would support our current and future Library needs.

                            Surfacing all assets <strong>removes unnecessary barriers</strong> to content for effortless stream start. By capturing all content 
                            regardless of type in this default view, we don't favor certain listeners over others which yields a <strong>personalized experience for all</strong>.

                            Users can quickly switch between viewing different content types in <strong>one tap</strong> with a tab navigation. As Library scales and iHeart's user base saves more content, 
                            this <strong>robust information architecture</strong> ensures that Library stays organized and easy to navigate.

                            Sorting gives users agency to organize their saved content as they desire and helps to surface relevant content that they are most likely to be interested in 
                            — offering a more <strong>engaging, personalized experience</strong>.

                            The copy and sort options were finalized after deliberating many others like Recents, Recently played, Recently followed, etc. Our final options
                            <strong>captured all relevant use cases</strong> and were <strong>successful in testing</strong>.

                        <p>
                            Depending on the selected tab, users will be able to further narrow down their view with filters.

                            With this, we retain the current ability of viewing only downloaded podcasts or created playlists, but still introduce that content

                            <strong>future scaling</strong>. Premium subscription users already have the ability to download 2 content types (Podcasts, Playlists).

                            It also acts as a pre-selected tab for an enhanced offline experience.

                        During my internship, I contributed to iHeart’s evolving design system, using Figma design tokens to 
                        create layered components with properties and variables. Below is an example of a navigation component I built (logo 
                        and text variants), accounting for responsive sizing and touch target dimensions. I also created iOS Native status bar 
                        components that can be coupled with our platform-flexible library.

                        We reached our final design recommendation by the end of my internship and this project is currently in development. The next 
                        steps would be creating handoff files, working with engineering to further provide support to develop the major features 
                        we are proposing that will impact multiple platforms. Engineering discovery sessions would be necessary to specify technical aspects
                         of the experience (offline experience, refresh frequency, overflows, etc). 
                        <br><br>
                        We would also prioritize working with analytics and product to implement a data tracking infrastructure for Library so that we can not
                         only measure the success of this Library initiative but also monitor and improve the product for the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I learned a lot about product design and management throughout the course of this project. Beyond gaining technical 
                        skills, I collaborated with many teams and people in my research process. Presenting my designs frequently refined my 
                        ability to explain my decisions, answer to different stakeholders, and think more critically about my work.
                        <br><br>
                        I also experienced operating in ambiguity. In my research process, I faced constraints such as the lack of data tracking within 
                        our current Library. Despite that, I learned how to capitalize on other the resources at our disposal to make informed design 
                        decisions.
                        <br><br>
                        Huge thank you to the iHeart digital product team, the UX team, and stakeholders for giving me the opportunity
                         to work on this impactful initiative.
